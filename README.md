# Full-Stack Stripe API Implementation

This project is a full-stack web application built using **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and integrates **Stripe APIs** for both subscription and usage-based billing. The application also leverages **Supabase** for user authentication and as a database solution. All user data is securely managed through Supabase, and all the photos displayed on the app were captured and edited by Michael Setji.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: User registration and login are handled securely through Supabase.
- **Subscription & Usage-Based Billing**: Stripe APIs are used to manage subscriptions, while usage-based billing is monitored in real-time via webhooks to calculate charges at the end of each billing cycle.
- **Real-Time Webhook Communication**: Webhooks ensure accurate billing and usage tracking by synchronizing data between Stripe and the application.
- **Responsive UI Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive interface, displaying original photography by Michael Setji.
